# Tech-Meet Hackathon

This was the problem of the hackathon:-

#Roadsâ€™ Leasing and Maintenance:

1.When Government leases roads to contractors, it has no way of checking the progress of the project and has to rely on manual surveys and what not.

2. Further, maintenance of the leased road is a huge pain. The government must perform regular surveys to check whether the road is in good condition.

3. Can you design a system where this process can be simplified or gamified by which we can crowd source this kind of data?

4. Make sure that a user who provides data can track the reported finding till it is resolved.

5. The system should be portable device friendly.
